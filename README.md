## Project Summary

For my teaching tenure presentation, I created this Power BI dashboard to demonstrate my impact on student learning. Using a collection of pre- and post-test scores based on benchmark assessments, the dashboard highlights the growth my students achieved across multiple math courses. It presents overall improvement trends, growth by individual course, and disaggregated data for special populations, including language learners, students with IEPs, and gender groups. This tool helped communicate student progress to stakeholders in a clear, data-driven way.

_Main dashboard view with an overview of pre-test scores compared to post-test scores. This view highlights the growth students achieved overall and provides a quick summary of improvement across all math courses._

### Overall Breakdown
![Overall Breakdown](dashboard-overll-breakdown.png)  
_Shows the score difference for all students across all courses. This visual breaks down the percentage of students who improved overall, stayed the same, or declined in performance._

### Course Breakdown
